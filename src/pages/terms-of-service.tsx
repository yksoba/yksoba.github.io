                We will discuss the scope of the commission, and I will give you
                an initial estimate of the total cost.

                You agree to pay 50% of initial estimate up-front, and the
                remainder of the total cost will be due within one week after
                delivery of the final product. We may also discuss alternate
                payment plans if necessary.

              You can expect me to send you:
              <ul>
                <li>First sketch within 1 week</li>
                <li>Lined draft within 2 weeks</li>
                <li>Flat-shaded draft within 3 weeks</li>
                <li>Full-color draft within 4-6 weeks</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              I will let you know if circumstances arise and the estimated
              turnaround will be longer. Please also let me know ahead of time
              if you need the finished piece by a strict deadline, and we can
              work things out.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may request edits or changes at any stage
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Minor edits will usually incur no additional charge
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Changes at the sketch level are almost always considered
                      minor, unless you are adding additional characters or
                      significantly increasing the complexity of your request
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Major edits (or an excessive number of edits) may incur
                  additional charge
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Changes after I have sent you the lineart draft are more
                      likely to be considered major changes, though edits that
                      concern only a small area of the piece will likely be
                      considered minor.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
              I will discuss these charges with you prior to commitment. We can
              continue to discuss different edits until you are satisfied with
              the expected product and cost. You may also opt to cancel your
              commission entirely, subject to the terms below

            <li>
              We may also use other communication media, depending on what fits
              the situation the best
            </li>
            <li>
              If I canâ€™t reach you (i.e., I do not get a reply from you within 2
              weeks), I may assume that you are canceling your commission.
              However, if extenuating circumstances arise, please let me know as
              soon as possible and we can discuss options (e.g., putting your
              commission on hold).

                  I do not anticipate that I will cancel your commission without

                </li>
                <li>
                  You will be entitled to a full refund, including any down
