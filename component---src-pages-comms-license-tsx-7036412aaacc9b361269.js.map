You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n          Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n          Distribute or Publicly Perform.

You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\n          to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n          Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n          Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\n          measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\n          Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n          the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\n          incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\n          apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n          License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\n          must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\n          as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an\n          Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n          practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\n          Section 4(c), as requested.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3\n          above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward\n          commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of\n          the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing\n          or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed\n          toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided\n          there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with\n          the exchange of copyrighted works.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\n          Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n          Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n          provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n          name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\n          and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\n          or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n          attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice,\n          terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\n          or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\n          extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n          specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n          refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\n          and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\n          a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n          \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay\n          based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by\n          this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\n          provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\n          a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\n          authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\n          credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\n          other contributing authors.
