      <p>
        Please read through this document carefully so you know what to expect
        throughout the process of commissioning my art. If you have any
        questions, feel free to{" "}

      <ul>
        <li>
          If you are interested in commissioning my art, please reserve a slot
          under the appropriate listing.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Note that reserving a slot does not necessarily mean that I will
              accept your commission. I reserve the right to accept or decline
              commission requests at my discretion.
            </li>
            <li>
              The request queues are reset each month. I will let you know if
              you are removed from the request queue, and you will be granted
              priority if you submit a reservation again.
            </li>
            <li>I will notify you when I start working on your commission.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Once I have started working on your commission, you can expect an
          initial sketch within a week. At this point, I encourage you to
          respond with some edits/suggestions to ensure the final product will
          match your expectations.
          <ul>
            <li>
              I expect to do multiple rounds of editing the initial sketch, but
              please allow up to a week between revisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Note that the price may vary from the base price depending on the
              complexity of the edits, the subject, excessive revisions, or
              other factors. I will let you know if any suggestions will incur
              an extra cost before you commit to them.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Once we agree on a sketch, I will send you an invoice.</b> Once the
          invoice is paid in full, I will begin work on the final drawing. At
          this point, only minor edits will be accepted, and major edits will
          incur an extra fee depending on the complexity of the edit. Please
          allow up to one month for the finished piece.
          <ul>
            <li>
              If circumstances arise that will delay the delivery of the final
              product, I will let you know and give you an updated timeline. At
              this point, you may cancel your order for a full refund, or you
              may opt to wait.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <li>Payment is accepted in USD via PayPal or Venmo only</li>

          Listed prices are base prices, and the final price may vary depending
          on the complexity of the design, additional characters, transaction fees, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Returns are not accepted once the initial sketch is approved unless
          the delivery of the final product is delayed.
